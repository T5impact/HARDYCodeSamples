# Code Samples for H.A.R.D.Y.

H.A.R.D.Y. is a simple 2D platformer with physics-based movement and was created for a month-long game jam as my very first game.

Below are some code samples for some of the systems I designed and created.

Despite this being my first game, I still priorised clean, clear, and structured code which I have maintained to this day.
